<h1>The Setup</h1>

<h3>Goal: setup a basic DirectX or OpenGL Monogame Project</h3>

<p>
I am assuming readers have a variety of knowledge about the following topics:
C#, Monogame, DirectX, OpenGL, Graphics Apis in general, and motherboards.
That last one might seem a little strange, but it's the most important.
We'll get to that soon tho. For now, we just need to setup a basic monogame
project and get the cornflower blue window running on the platform.
